However, successful practical applications of the research have been slow in coming, encountering more difficulties than many had predicted. This course will undertake a survey of AI research areas and applications, address the major obstacles and problems of the field, and then examine so­called expert systems. The course work will include a presentation/ paper on some AI topic as well as programming rudimentary expert systems using the logic programming language Prolog."

Cognitive science assumes that the brain is some sort of computational engine, and, beginning with that premise, attempts to find answers to such questions. This course will be taught by faculty from biology, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology, who will combine their different approaches to explore how humans and other intelligent systems feel, perceive, reason, plan, and act. In particular, the course will focus on the fundamental importance of language, signaling, and representation at many levels, from the neural to the organismal. Laboratories will provide students with hands-on experience analyzing neural and behavioral data as well as with computational modeling."

Cognitive science assumes that the brain is some sort of computational engine, and, beginning with that premise, attempts to find answers to such questions. This course will be taught by faculty from biology, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology, who will combine their different approaches to explore how humans and other intelligent systems feel, perceive, reason, plan, and act.  In particular, the course will focus on the fundamental importance of language, signaling, and representation at many levels, from the neural to the organismal. Laboratories will provide students with hands-on experience analyzing neural and behavioral data as well as with computational modeling."

Students will create and run several different simulation model types drawn from a variety of disciplines, including: artificial life, cognitive science, economics, environmental science, evolution, neuroscience, physics, and political science. Students will gain a practical understanding of how to combine mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and data analysis as they use and create software that enables them to build simulation models that answer a practical need and/or scientific question. No prior knowledge of computer programming is required."

Building on skills acquired in Object-Oriented Programming, we will focus on the construction of more sophisticated and reliable computer programs that employ the most important data structures. Data structures, common ways in which data is organized and manipulated, are an important aspect of more advanced programming. Consequently, throughout the course students will be introduced to the most useful data structures, including files, lists, stacks, trees, and graphs. Students will write several programs, ranging from short lab assignments to larger systems of their own design. This course covers the implementation and use of advanced data structures such as stacks, queues, hash tables, binary search trees, sets, and graphs via an object-oriented programming language."

In object-oriented programming, these two kinds of refinement often mesh as we design and build software objects that model important aspects of the problem and of its solution. This course, which is intended for students with prior programming experience, introduces students to the methodology of object-oriented design and development via guided student work, solving interesting problems drawn from such arenas as graphics and animation, simulation, and/or Internet applications. Good programming and documentation habits are emphasized."

						"description": "If an android can be programmed to behave just like me, does the android have a mind just like mine? If my dog has a big brain (and she does), how is her way of being conscious different from my conscious awareness? Will my clone, with a brain just like mine, behave just like me? (Will my clone's brain really be just like mine?) If \"the mind\" simply \"what the brain does\", can my mind be active while my brain is asleep or comatose? What about unconscious processes? This course provides a variety of empirical approaches to the study of mind, brain, and behavior, and together we will test answers to questions like these--questions that can only be addressed using the multidisciplinary methods of Cognitive Science. Rather than attempting a broad survey of an impossibly large field, we will delve deeply into a few topics. Special attention will be given to perception, human learning, robotics, language, neural networks, how gene expression influences behavior, the representation of knowledge, and philosophy of mind. Course work and readings emphasize analytic approaches, including practice in formulating questions that lead to testable hypotheses. Laboratories will provide hands-on experience, emphasizing data collection and data analysis."

In this course, we'll apply techniques from Natural Language Processing (the subdiscipline of computer science that deals with information in text form) to all kinds of texts. We’ll identify hapax legomena (words that appear only once in a given text) and think about whether and when they are significant. We'll see how scholars try to use statistical techniques to approach disputes over authorship. Each student will work alone or with a small group to pose an interesting question about a specific text or corpus and to construct computational tools for beginning to address the question."

This class will serve as a hands-on introduction to the practice of programming drones, small embedded computers connected with sensors and actuators. Through guest lectures by distinguished practitioners in fields such as human rights, international law, media studies, literature, robotics, and history, as well as vigorous class discussion, we will consider drones from aesthetic, social, moral, and policy perspectives. Students will learn how computers can observe and manipulate the physical world as well as calculate in the virtual world, while reflecting on the social and political implications of drone technology. No prior knowledge of computer programming is required."

These concurrent developments have sparked exciting collaborations between literary scholars and computer scientists (as evidenced by this co-taught course). Yet this burgeoning affinity can easily obscure the longer history of scholarly activity combining humanist and computational approaches to literature. In this course, we will chart the contours of this history -- stretching back to the early twentieth century -- and learn the fundamentals of NLP in order to consider new questions regarding changing literary patterns over time. We will read the works of foundational linguists and close-reading theorists (e.g., Victoria, Lady Welby; C. K. Ogden; I. A. Richards; William Empson; and Cleanth Brooks) as well as scholars of emergent critical reading practices (eg., N. Katherine Hayles, Franco Moretti, Sharon Marcus, and Stephen Best). We will explore these ideas by learning fundamentals of programming and then using them to apply NLP techniques such as parsing, sentence generation, language modeling, and creation of high-dimensional semantic spaces to problems in reading."
